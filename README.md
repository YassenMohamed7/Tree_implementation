#Binary tree implementation:

In this project we will implement some functions as following:

# Insert

this function is used to insert an element in the tree.

#preOrder

this function is used to print the data as follow
([root], [left subtree], [right subtree]).

#inOrder

this function is used to print the data as follow
([left subtree], [root], [right subtree]).

#postOrder

this function is used to print the data as follow
([left subtree], [right subtree], [root]).


#levelOrder

this function is used to print the data from top of the tree
to bottom and from left to right.
